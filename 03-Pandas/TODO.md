## Ideas for notebooks

* Split in a variety of topics

1. Input and output
1a. Read_sql (various queries), play a bit with head/tail and UI. Explain the concept of variables and dataframes
1b. The content of B1 but without the transformations
1c. Minimal example of writing to SQL

2. Descriptive statistics and plots (histograms, KDE, line plots, bar plots, scatterplots, 2d histograms, 2d density plots)
* Single-variable descriptive statistics for numeric/dates (histograms + KDE)
* Single-variable descriprive statitistics for categorical variables (bar plots)
* Two-dimensional descriptive statistics (line plots, scatterplots, 2d-histograms, 2d-density plots)
* Visualization lecture (channels, color, etc)

3. Data manipulation and transformations
* Filter, query, rename, drop
* Pivot tables and group by (without temporal resampling)
* Normalization notebook
* Political views and books notebook

4. Time series
* Resampling datetime index
* Autocorrelation and lag plots
* Seasonal decomposition
* Prophet

5. Geographical data
* Basic plots, 2d kernel plots etc
* Shapefiles for boundaries
* Shapefiles and choropleths
* Shapefiles and spatial joins
