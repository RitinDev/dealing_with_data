In the examples above, we relied on a \"black box\" where we simply asked for the time series to be decomposed into a trend, seasonal, and residual component. Now, let's dig a bit deeper on how we can extract trend components that are unaffected by seasonality.\n",

        "For that, we often rely on \"window\" functions, that operate over a set of continuous time series points. For example, if we have a time series that has a 12-month seasonality, we can take the 12-month average, which will not exhibit seasonality, but will capture the trend. \n",
